# Moon_Votes

Group work of the 8ยบ week of bootcamp, more precisely in the weekend, we received the challenge on Friday and delivered the first stable version on Monday morning.

We developed a network game of questions, where each participant can vote for another participant and then the results are shown. 
The goal is to have fun and laugh a lot even if you are away.
